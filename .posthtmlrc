There are, however, 140 pharmacies, delis, and convenience stores and 30 stores from among the top 50 largest American fast-food chains in the same region.

It's usually outside businesses or people coming in.”"

Gant, for example, has to take the subway to get to the Whole Foods on 96th Street and Columbus, though the commute takes about 20 minutes and he has to walk three blocks to the store once getting off the subway. He considers the journey worthwhile, however, due to “the variety and the quality of the vegetables and the meat” at the Whole Foods."
