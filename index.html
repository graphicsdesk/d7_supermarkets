Meanwhile, just 40 blocks north, many shoppers walk out of stores like CTown and Key Foods with bags of Doritos and boxes of Lucky Charmscereal boxes. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Areas of Harlem have long been understood to be food deserts, or geographic areas where residents have limited access to healthy fresh food. Though the food landscape in West Harlem has not attracted as much attention from researchers in the past as that ofareas like Central and East Harlem have, residents still feel there is a significant need for improvement. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “It’s better than it used to be, but not as good as it should be,” Cary Gant, a resident of Hamilton Heights, said regarding the overall accessibility of healthy food in West Harlem. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> FCauses of food deserts can often be traced to several contributing root factors, including unaffordable prices of healthy food, a physical lack of stores selling healthy food, and/or a limited variety oflack of variety in the healthy food offered by existing stores. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “A newer term that people are using these days is ‘food swamp’ because [the issue is] not only what fresh healthy food is available — it's also what unhealthy cheap food is available,” Dr. Katherine Burt, an assistant professor at Lehman College whose research focuses on inequities in food systems in New York City, said. “While I might not say that West Harlem is necessarily a food desert, I would certainly say it is a food swamp. There's a lot of cheap, unhealthy food available all over.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Gant expressed similar sentiments about the variety of products offered in food stores around Harlem. Though he often shops outside of Harlem, Gant chose to visit a local store on a particularly cold day in January rather than walk to Whole Foods or Trader Joes. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “It’s a lot of processed junk food,” Gant said when asked about the variety of products offered in his neighborhood storsfood stores around Harlem. “Just not healthy choices…... I mean, I shop outside of Harlem a lot. I live only a few blocks away [from a local supermarket in Hamilton Heights] but it’s cold and I don’t feel like going to Whole Foods or to Trader Joe’s [today]. So I’m coming here today, but I just got some little stuff. It’s not real food items, right? Juice and stuff like that. Eggs, sweet potatoes. But that’s it. I’m done. And the rest, I’ll save — for my vegetables and all — I’m going to kind of save for when I go to Whole Foods.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Indeed, data collected by Spectator showed that there were only 88 grocery stores carrying fresh produce in City Council District 7, which stretches from 96th to 165th street. There are, however,, compared to the 140 pharmacies, delis, and convenience stores and 30 stores from among the top 50 largest American fast-food chains in the same region. The disparities are even more apparent between different neighborhoods in District 7, with ______ in Hamilton Heights compared to ______ in Manhattanville. … <b>[discuss graphics team data/info]</b> </p> <div class="graphic"> <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang="en"><head><meta charset="utf-8"><title>Points on a map</title><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><script src="https://api.tiles.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/v2.6.1/mapbox-gl.js"></script><link href="https://api.tiles.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/v2.6.1/mapbox-gl.css" rel="stylesheet"><style>body{margin:10;padding:10}#map{position:relative;height:900px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:600px}</style></head><body> <div id="map"></div> <script>mapboxgl.accessToken="pk.eyJ1IjoiZWxlYW5vcmwiLCJhIjoiY2t5b3lraWEyMDR1ZjJybGVobjBwNDZ6aCJ9.zDa5cMUEyouVGsmMgf5vPA";var e=document.getElementById("filter-group"),o=new mapboxgl.Map({container:"map",style:"mapbox://styles/eleanorl/ckyryujf408so16nmmgdh4ls5",center:[-73.95,40.81],zoom:12});o.on("click",function(e){var t=o.queryRenderedFeatures(e.point,{layers:["d7-supermarkets-cleaned"]});if(t.length){var r=t[0];new mapboxgl.Popup({offset:[0,-15]}).setLngLat(r.geometry.coordinates).setHTML("<h3>".concat(r.properties.title,"</h3>\n            <p><b>Category: </b>").concat(r.properties.retailer_type,"</p>\n            <p><b>Address: </b>").concat(r.properties.address,"</p>")).addTo(o)}});</script> </body></html> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> The 2018 Community Health Profiles by the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene reported a similar disparity, with a ratio of 11eleven bodegas to one supermarket in West Harlem, compared to the ratio of three bodegas to one supermarket onin the Upper West Side. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Studies have also shown that, across New York City, areas with limited access to healthy food often correspond to areas with higher proportions of Black residents, a population that suffers from disproportionately high rates of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Burt attributes many inequities in food systems to “historical racism against people of color,” which she says is especially apparent in Upper Manhattan because of the close proximity of “very affluent white areas and then neighborhoods that are quite different right next door.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> The disproportionate presence of fast food restaurants specifically may have historical roots in unequal zoning practices, Burt added. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “Zoning regulations were much more restricted in more residential, affluent areas. And so to get approval for a supermarket to go in versus fast food restaurants, we just saw differences in how city blocks were zoned and who got the ‘in,.’” Burt explained. “When we also look back historically to who's getting business loans to open up things like restaurants in neighborhoods, it's not typically people of color who live in those communities to exert more community control. It's usually outside businesses or people coming in.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Due to the relative scarcity of stores that provideproviding a substantial variety of healthy food, West Harlem residents looking to buy products like fresh produce and organic meant residents often have to commute farther to do their shoppingshop at supermarkets that do. Gant, for example, has to take the subway to get to the Whole Foods on 96th Street and Columbus, though “that’s, what, 20 minutes? And I walk over three blocks, but it’s worth it to get the variety and the quality of the vegetables and the meat.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> While the physical distance of healthier supermarkets poses a significant challenge to West Harlem residents, Gant believes that the price of healthy food is an even bigger impediment for many. More importantly than physical distance to supermarkets, however, Gant believes “the most prevalent reason” that many residents don’t often buy healthy food is “the price of food.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “I definitely would say [healthy food] is more expensive,” Izzy Falkovich, another resident of Hamilton Heights, agreed. “So I think it’s available, but class-wise, I don’t think it’s accessible.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> In terms of the variety of produce offered in stores, she said, “I think it’s there, but I think there could be more. Like it exists, but I would love to see more options.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> According to the Community Health Profilesaforementioned NYC Department of Health data, the percentage of adults eating at least one serving of fruits or vegetables per day was 92 percent onin the Upper West Side, 88 percent in Morningside Heights and Hamilton Heights, and 84 percent in Central Harlem. Meanwhile, the percentage of adults suffering from diabetes was 5 percent onin the Upper West Side, 10 percent in Morningside Heights and Hamilton Heights, and 12 percent in Central Harlem. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> In light of the limited structural access to healthy food, community leaders and grassroots organizations have long been working on food justice initiatives in Harlem. The nonprofit Harlem Grown, founded by Tony Hillery in 2008, transforms abandoned lots into urban farms, gives the resultant produce to the community for free, and teaches youth about sustainability and nutrition through programs on those farms. Numerous community fridges, often operated by resident organizers, are located on sidewalks across New York and allow people to take fresh produce, dairy, and other food products anonymously and free of charge. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Despite the support provided by the community, however, it is clear that deep structural change is still needed to ensure more equitable access to healthy food in Harlem. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “Policymakers should be engaging people on neighborhood levels, community levels,” Burt said. “On the flip side of that, we really need people in communities to be able to have the opportunity to engage more. What that means is not expecting people to volunteer their time for giving input, and compensating people properly even if they're not trained experts in their field.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “Neighborhoods should have more control and more oversight and more say over what happens in their spaces,” Burt added. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <i>Esther Sun is a staff writer.
