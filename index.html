Meanwhile, just 40 blocks north, many shoppers walk out of stores like CTown and Key Foods with bags of Doritos and boxes of Lucky Charms. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Areas of Harlem have long been understood to be food deserts, or geographic areas where residents have limited access to healthy fresh food. Though the food landscape in West Harlem has not attracted as much attention from researchers as that of Central and East Harlem, residents still feel there is a significant need for improvement. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “It’s better than it used to be, but not as good as it should be,” Cary Gant, a resident of Hamilton Heights, said regarding the overall accessibility of healthy food in West Harlem. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Food deserts can often be traced to several contributing root factors, including unaffordable prices of healthy food, a physical lack of stores selling healthy food, and a limited variety of healthy food offered by existing stores. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “A newer term that people are using these days is ‘food swamp’ because [the issue is] not only what fresh healthy food is available — it's also what unhealthy cheap food is available,” Dr. Katherine Burt, an assistant professor at Lehman College whose research focuses on inequities in food systems in New York City, said. “While I might not say that West Harlem is necessarily a food desert, I would certainly say it is a food swamp. There's a lot of cheap, unhealthy food available all over.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Gant expressed similar sentiments about the variety of products offered in food stores around Harlem. Though he often shops outside of Harlem, Gant chose to visit a local store on a particularly cold day in January rather than walk to Whole Foods or Trader Joes. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “It’s a lot of processed junk food,” Gant said when asked about the variety of products offered in his neighborhood stores. “Just not healthy choices… I’m coming here today, but I just got some little stuff. It’s not real food items, right? Juice and stuff like that. Eggs, sweet potatoes. But that’s it. I’m done. And the rest, I’ll save—for my vegetables and all—I’m going to kind of save for when I go to Whole Foods.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Indeed, Spectator Graphics analyzed data from the <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/43nn-pn8j">New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene</a> and the <a href="https://data.ny.gov/Economic-Development/Retail-Food-Stores-Map/p2dn-xhaw">New York Department of Agriculture and Markets</a> and found that there were only 88 grocery stores carrying fresh produce in City Council District 7, which stretches from 96th to 165th street. There are, however, 140 pharmacies, delis, and convenience stores and 30 stores from among the top 50 largest American fast-food chains in the same region. Spectator’s interactive mapping of these stores, which readers can explore below, also shows that food store distribution throughout District 7 is far from uniform, with stores mainly being concentrated along Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue. </p> <div class="graphic"> <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang="en"><head><meta charset="utf-8"><title>Points on a map</title><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><script src="https://api.tiles.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/v2.6.1/mapbox-gl.js"></script><link href="https://api.tiles.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/v2.6.1/mapbox-gl.css" rel="stylesheet"><style>body{margin:10;padding:10}#map{position:relative;height:900px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:600px}</style></head><body> <div id="map"></div> <script>mapboxgl.accessToken="pk.eyJ1IjoiZWxlYW5vcmwiLCJhIjoiY2t5b3lraWEyMDR1ZjJybGVobjBwNDZ6aCJ9.zDa5cMUEyouVGsmMgf5vPA";var e=document.getElementById("filter-group"),o=new mapboxgl.Map({container:"map",style:"mapbox://styles/eleanorl/ckyryujf408so16nmmgdh4ls5",center:[-73.95,40.81],zoom:12});o.on("click",function(e){var t=o.queryRenderedFeatures(e.point,{layers:["d7-supermarkets-cleaned"]});if(t.length){var r=t[0];new mapboxgl.Popup({offset:[0,-15]}).setLngLat(r.geometry.coordinates).setHTML("<h3>".concat(r.properties.title,"</h3>\n            <p><b>Category: </b>").concat(r.properties.retailer_type,"</p>\n            <p><b>Address: </b>").concat(r.properties.address,"</p>")).addTo(o)}});</script> </body></html> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> The 2018 Community Health Profiles by the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene reported a similar disparity, with a ratio of 11 bodegas to one supermarket in West Harlem, compared to the ratio of three bodegas to one supermarket on the Upper West Side. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Studies have also shown that, across New York City, areas with limited access to healthy food often correspond to areas with higher proportions of Black residents, a population that suffers from disproportionately high rates of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Burt attributes many inequities in food systems to “historical racism against people of color,” which she says is especially apparent in Upper Manhattan because of the close proximity of affluent white neighborhoods and poorer neighborhoods with more people of color. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> The disproportionate presence of fast food restaurants specifically may have historical roots in unequal zoning practices, Burt added. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “Zoning regulations were much more restricted in more residential, affluent areas. And so to get approval for a supermarket to go in versus fast food restaurants, we just saw differences in how city blocks were zoned and who got the ‘in,’” Burt explained. “When we also look back historically to who's getting business loans to open up things like restaurants in neighborhoods, it's not typically people of color who live in those communities to exert more community control. It's usually outside businesses or people coming in.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Due to the relative scarcity of stores that provide a substantial variety of healthy food, West Harlem residents looking to buy products like fresh produce and organic meat often have to commute farther to do their shopping. Gant, for example, has to take the subway to get to the Whole Foods on 96th Street and Columbus, though the commute takes about 20 minutes and he has to walk three blocks to the store once getting off the subway. He considers the journey worthwhile, however, due to “the variety and the quality of the vegetables and the meat” at the Whole Foods. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> While the physical distance of healthier supermarkets poses a significant challenge to West Harlem residents, Gant believes that the price of healthy food is an even bigger impediment for many. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Izzy Falkovich, another resident of Hamilton Heights, expressed that, though stores in West Harlem do offer some selections of produce, there is a need for a greater variety of options. Like Gant, she believes that high prices restrict residents from buying healthy food. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “I definitely would say [healthy food] is more expensive,” Falkovich said. “So I think it’s available, but class-wise, I don’t think it’s accessible.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> According to the Community Health Profiles, the percentage of adults eating at least one serving of fruits or vegetables per day was 92 percent on the Upper West Side, 88 percent in Morningside Heights and Hamilton Heights, and 84 percent in Central Harlem. Meanwhile, the percentage of adults suffering from diabetes was 5 percent on the Upper West Side, 10 percent in Morningside Heights and Hamilton Heights, and 12 percent in Central Harlem. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> In light of the limited access to healthy food, community leaders and grassroots organizations have long been working on food justice initiatives in Harlem. The nonprofit Harlem Grown, founded by Tony Hillery in 2011, transforms abandoned lots into urban farms, gives the resultant produce to the community for free, and teaches youth about sustainability and nutrition through programs on those farms. Numerous community fridges, often operated by resident organizers, are located on sidewalks across New York and allow people to take fresh produce, dairy, and other food products anonymously and free of charge. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Despite the support provided by the community, however, it is clear that deep structural change is still needed to ensure more equitable access to healthy food in Harlem. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “Policymakers should be engaging people on neighborhood levels, community levels,” Burt said on residents’ limited influence over citywide politics. She believes that many residents of colo in Upper Manhattan have less control over their own communities and the food immediately available in their neighborhoods, which has contributed to the overall disparities in access to healthful items. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <i>Esther Sun is a staff writer.
